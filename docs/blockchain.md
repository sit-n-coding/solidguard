## Environment Variables
* **Etherscan** - Third Party API used for getting blockchain information.
  * `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` Etherscan API key. You will need to create an account to generate one. See [this](https://info.etherscan.com/api-keys/) for more information.
* **Ethereum** - Blockchain used for SolidGuard. Note that the network referred must be consistent between Etherscan and all blockchain-related environment variables.
  * `DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY` Private key used to deploy the SolidGuardManager contract. Make sure it has enough Ether to deploy!
  * `PROVIDER_URL` Blockchain provider URL to get information from the blockchain via the `ethers` library. You can use [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://infura.io/) here, just make sure the network it is providing is the same as the Etherscan API URL (i.e. must use a goerli provider url if using goerli.etherscan).

## Local Setup

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
Fill in the following environment variables in a new file called `.env`. Examples of these variables can be seen in [`.env.example`](../.env.example), and information can be seen [here](#environment-variables).

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Deploy smart contract

Run the script via hardhat that will deploy the SolidGuardManager.

```bash
npx hardhat run ./deploy/main/solid-guard-manager.deploy.ts --network providerNetwork
```

### 4. Verify on Etherscan

Using the SolidGuardManager's implementation address, use it to verify the smart contract on Etherscan.

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network providerNetwork <SGM_IMPL_ADDR>
```
